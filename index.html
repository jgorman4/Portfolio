            <p2> Hello there! I am <span class = "intel-Text">Geospatial Specialist </span> with the Texas A&M Forest Service. I have developed a passion
                for solving complex natural resource issues with various geospatial plaforms and tools, especially as it pertains to wildlife conservation.
                This passion grew from my combined experience as an <span class = "intel-Text"> Imagery Intelligence Anaylst</span> 
                for the Army National Guard, a <span class = "intel-Text">Rangeland Conservationist</span> for the USDA-NRCS, and from undergraduate and graduate degrees.
                 To further my interest in GIS, I pursued a second Master of Science
                in Geographic Information Science.
            </p2>

            <p3> As the world of GIS technology rapidly evolves, I love to learn new skill sets that help us solve our world's most pressing issues.
                I am always looking for opportunities to improve my <span class = "skill-Text"> programming knowledge </span> with Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and SQL, 
                <span class = "skill-Text">imagery analysis </span> with Google Earth Engine, and <span class = "skill-Text"> statistical analysis </span> with AI and Machine Learning.
